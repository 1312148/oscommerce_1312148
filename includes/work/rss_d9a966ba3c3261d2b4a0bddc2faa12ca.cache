The optional &quot;Add-Ons&quot; have not be tested.<br />

Changes:<br />
<br />
1. Added code to place a button to go directly to the Invoice on account_history.php<br />
<br />
2. Added an extra config variable to select the Order Status level that the invoice will be available to the customer at. Previously you had a True/False to have the button appear on &quot;Delivered&quot; only orders or all orders. Now you can specify any Order Status.";s:7:"pubDate";s:31:"Sun, 30 Oct 2016 02:45:43 +0100";}i:2;a:4:{s:5:"title";s:21:"Wholesale (SPPC lite)";s:4:"link";s:38:"http://addons.oscommerce.com/info/9416";s:11:"description";s:389:"Changes Version 2.0:<br />

This page now shows module class and adds a toggle to quickly view status/enable/disable every installed module without accessing to its config page. Very handy to check if an installed module is enable or not at a glance.<br />
<br />
Works with navbar, boxes, action recorder, header tags, social bookmarks, shipping, payment and all other standard modules.<br />

Since there <br />
is still a need for a contribution like this I updated it to work with v2.3.4 BSr and changed the name of it a little.<br />
<br />
For Get Qty/Price Feed from Supplier 1.05 and before, credit is given to the respective authors.<br />
<br />
This contribution has been updated to work with osC v2.3.4 Bootstrap Responsive. It has been tested with Apache, PHP 7 MYSQL 5.6 and Mozilla FireFox.<br />
It may or may not work with other versions of osC, PHP, MYSQL and browsers. I am not sure, I have not tested it that far. I just made it work for me.<br />
<br />
THIS IS FOR CSV FILES ONLY!<br />
<br />
The purpose of this contribution is so that you can keep your product prices and quantities in stock updated correctly so that they match with your supplier.<br />
<br />
It will NOT add new products to your database.<br />
<br />
This contribution can make the procedure of updating your prices and quantities automatic by using a cron job.<br />
If you need to or choose to, you can do it manually through your browser as well if a cron job is not a option available to you.<br />
The frequency of the cron job may be set to run as often as your supplier updates their prices and quantities or that your host allows.<br />
The manual option can also be ran as often as your supplier updates their file or that your host allows as well.<br />
<br />
This contribution has the capability to adjust the suppliers prices using a markup percentage that you set.<br />
<br />
It also has the capability to limit prices to the MAP (Minimum Advertised Price) per manufacturer requirements.";s:7:"pubDate";s:31:"Fri, 28 Oct 2016 00:01:35 +0200";}}s:11:"items_count";i:5;}
